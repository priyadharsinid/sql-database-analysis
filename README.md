This project involves analyzing a SQL database by completing the following tasks:

### Data Modeling:

Inspect the CSV files and sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables.

### Data Engineering:

Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

### Data Analysis:
